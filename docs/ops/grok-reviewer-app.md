# Grok Reviewer GitHub App + mechanical check gate (v2)

User-owned GitHub App posts **formal** PR reviews (`REQUEST_CHANGES` /
`COMMENT`) from `.github/workflows/grok-review.yml`.

**Merge trust is not Reviews API APPROVE.** Measured 2026-08-01 on PR #222:
`infektydgrokreviewer[bot]` (and Cursor bot) can post `APPROVE`, but
`reviewDecision` stays `REVIEW_REQUIRED` (`authorAssociation=NONE`) on this
user-owned repo. v2 therefore uses a **required check run**
`grok-mechanical-approve` from `.github/workflows/grok-approve-gate.yml`.

## v2 policy

| Model line | Reviews API | Mechanical check |
|---|---|---|
| `VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES` | `REQUEST_CHANGES` | stays **failure** (blocks) |
| `VERDICT: COMMENT` | `COMMENT` | **failure** until eligibility |
| `VERDICT: APPROVE` | `COMMENT` + eligibility marker | **success** only if every *other* required status is `success` |
| missing / garbage | `COMMENT` | **failure** |

Eligibility marker stamped into the App review body:

```html
<!-- grok-mechanical-eligibility: APPROVE -->
```

Invariants (enforced in `.github/scripts/grok_approve_gate.py`):

1. Red or pending required checks → never success.
2. Empty required-context list → fail closed.
3. Head SHA re-read before post; abort if moved.
4. Gate script loaded from **default branch** only.
5. Required contexts read from branch protection API (not hardcoded), with
   `grok-mechanical-approve` itself excluded so the check is never its own
   prerequisite.
6. PRs touching **any** `.github/` path stay red (path filter) — a workflow
   there can weaken a required check the gate trusts.
7. Only `infektydgrokreviewer[bot]` may carry the eligibility marker
   (`APP_BOT_LOGINS`). A `[bot]`-suffix test would be forgeable: any same-repo
   PR can post a review as `github-actions[bot]` with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
8. The marker must be a line of its own. The review body embeds the model's
   reply verbatim, so `grok-review.yml` also defangs any marker the model
   echoed out of the diff before posting.

Parser: `.github/scripts/parse_grok_verdict.py` — default path never emits
Reviews `APPROVE`; `--allow-approve` is for gate/eligibility readers only.

## Create the App

1. GitHub → **Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**.
2. Name something like `infektyd-grok-reviewer` (must be globally unique).
3. Homepage URL: your choice (repo or `https://github.com/infektyd`).
4. **Webhook:** uncheck Active (Actions mints tokens; no webhook needed).
5. **Permissions → Repository:**
   - Pull requests: **Read & write**
   - Metadata: **Read-only**
   - Nothing else (check runs use `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the gate workflow).
6. **Where can this GitHub App be installed?** → Only on this account.
7. Create App → note **App ID**.
8. **Generate a private key** → download the `.pem`. Do not commit it.

## Install (allowlist)

Prefer **Only select repositories** (`minni` ± canary). If install is
`all`, tighten it.

## Secrets & variables

| Name | Kind | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `GROK_APP_ID` | Repository **variable** | numeric App ID |
| `GROK_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Repository **secret** | full PEM text |
| `GROK_CI_AUTH_JSON` | Repository **secret** | Grok CLI auth (see `.github/workflows/grok.yml`) |

## Branch protection (operator — propose, don't silent-apply)

To stop needing `--admin` for solo merges, make the mechanical check + real CI
required, and drop the approving-review count that bots cannot satisfy:

```bash
# PROPOSE to the operator; confirm strict=true (forces up-to-date) before running.
gh api -X PUT repos/infektyd/minni/branches/main/protection \
  --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": [
      "Forbidden Files",
      "Free public cloud smoke",
      "boundary",
      "claude-review",
      "grok-mechanical-approve"
    ]
  },
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 0,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true
  },
  "restrictions": null
}
JSON
```

Keep `required_approving_review_count: 1` only if you still want a **human**
review in addition to the mechanical check (bots still will not count).

## Residual risk

A green mechanical check means “eligible Grok verdict + required CI green” —
**not** correctness. Agent-authored PRs can still ship bad-but-green code.
Keep `enforce_admins: false` as a manual escape hatch. Path filter forces
human attention on gate/workflow changes.

## Recovery

- `REQUEST_CHANGES` from the App clears eligibility until a later review
  stamps the marker again (re-open / ready_for_review to re-run Grok).
- **A `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review keeps the check red until it is DISMISSED**,
  even after a later review stamps the marker. The gate reads every review, not
  just the newest per author, so a stale block does not silently expire. Dismiss
  it (`gh pr review --dismiss`) or push a new SHA and let Grok re-review.
- Push → new SHA → gate re-runs on `synchronize` / check completion (L4).
